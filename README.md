Resizer for Eternal Card Game 


Janky of jankiest resizer for Eternal Card Game, the game pretty much supports all kinds of different resolutions but doesn't let you pick them from their drop-down list.

Start Eternal and the resizer  
Make sure Eternal is in windowed mode 
Make sure Eternal is NOT minimalised
Input your desired resolution in the resizer and click OK. It should now resize your Eternal window and you'll have 10 seconds to confirm in-game or the game will auto-revert to its previous resolution.
