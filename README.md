Resizer for Eternal Card Game 


Jankiest of janky resizer for Eternal Card Game, the game pretty much supports all kinds of different resolutions but doesn't always let you pick them from their drop-down list.

If you have AutoHotkey installed you can run the .ahk script, else you can use the compiled version .exe

# How to  
- Start Eternal and the resizer  
- Make sure Eternal is in windowed mode  
- Make sure Eternal is NOT minimalised  
- Input your desired resolution in the resizer and click OK. It should now resize your Eternal window and you'll have 10 seconds to confirm in-game or the game will auto-revert to its previous resolution.
